                        </h3>
                        <div class="answer">
                            If you booking is changed, your NIDACash is still reflected on your account. Do note that NIDACash is only redeemable when guests check out from the hotel.
                            <br>
                            If you cancel your booking, NIDACash will be cancelled accordingly. In other words, you are not eligible to earn cash for that particular booking.
