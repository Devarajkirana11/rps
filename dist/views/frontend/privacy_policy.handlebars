                <h4 class="fw-semi-thk text-black">What We Believe In</h4>

                <p>We believe in a world where travelers can live to experience the authenticity of any place they visit. This is why our hotels are carefully selected and screened to be strategically located at central areas for easy accessibility to both work and play. All hotels are further enhanced with features like:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Day Use:</strong> To complement the needs of modern travelers who intend to use the room for up to 4 hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Long Stay:</strong> Catered to extended stays beyond 7 days </li>
                    <li><strong>WiFi:</strong> Seamless WiFi connection within the premise of hotel to stay connected with loved ones or for work</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay:</strong> More value for money for guests for longer stays. Check out time is calculated from the check-in time of the first date (not the standard 12pm checkout time practiced in the hospitality industry)</li>
                    <li><strong>Room Selection:</strong> Innovative feature allowing guests to pre-select rooms they like as part of the online booking process</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Close proximity to key public transport hubs and major attractions in the city</li>
                </ul>
