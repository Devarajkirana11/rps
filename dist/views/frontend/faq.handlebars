            <h3 class="question">What is Hotel NIDA?
              <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
            </h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Hotel NIDA takes independent boutique hotels under the Hotel NIDA brand and further enhance it with
                essential
                features to provide guests with seamless experience, along with enhanced flexibility and low prices.</p>
              <p>From a hotel perspective, we provide a seamless hotel operating system which encapsulates all the
                modules to
                run an independent operated hotel combining elements of an airline revenue management system with
                dynamic
                pricing.</p>
              <p>Hotel operators can run their hotels using our platform with the option of two models.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The first is a full franchise model, where hotel operators use the platform and rebrand their
                  property as
                  a Nida Hotel.
                </li>
                <li>The second option is the semi-franchise model where the hotels keep their brand but use the Nida
                  platform
                  to run their property.

              <p>No. All payments will be made when you book the hotel at the platform. Just present your booking

            <div class="answer">
              <p>We do not own the hotels here. We merely take independent hotels under the Hotel Nida brand under 2

              <div class="plus-minus-toggle collapsed"></div>
            </h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Flexi Stay is a feature that maximises your value for money on each room booking. This feature allows
                guests
                to check out at the time that they check in. For example, Sam arrives at the hotel on Friday evening,
                5pm. He
                is entitled to stay in the hotel room till 5pm Saturday (instead of the standard 12pm check out
                time).</p>
